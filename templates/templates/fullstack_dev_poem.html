<h2>Full-Stack Dev poem</h2>
<p>
    In realms of code and web's domain,<br>
    A full-stack dev, their passion's flame.<br>
    With logic's art and design's grace,<br>
    They weave a tapestry of digital space.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    From front to back, they build with care,<br>
    A seamless blend, a digital pair.<br>
    The client-side, where pixels dance,<br>
    And backend's power, a symphony's glance.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Through HTML's structure, CSS's art,<br>
    They craft the user's interactive start.<br>
    With JavaScript's magic, they bring to life,<br>
    The interactive elements, taking flight.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    On the server-side, where data resides,<br>
    The full-stack dev, their knowledge presides.<br>
    With Python, databases and APIs, they intertwine,<br>
    Connecting the front, the backend's design.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    From simple forms to complex apps,<br>
    Their expertise ensures the web's rapid taps.<br>
    A symphony of skills, a blend so grand,<br>
    The full-stack dev, a digital artisan.<br>
    </p>
