# Configuration

You need to install Python on your operating system before you can use it in Visual Studio Code.  

Visual Studio Code is a code editor, not an interpreter. It needs a Python interpreter to execute Python code.

Here are the steps on how to install Python on your operating system:  


**Windows:**

1. Go to the Python download page: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for Windows.
2. Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Make sure to add Python to your system PATH during the installation. This will allow you to run Python from the command line.


**macOS:**

1. Open Terminal.
2. Type `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh | bash` and press Enter.
3. Type `brew install python` and press Enter.  


**Linux:**

The installation process for Linux will vary depending on your distribution. However, the general steps are as follows:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Type `sudo apt-get install python3` and press Enter.  


Once Python is installed on your operating system, you can open Visual Studio Code (or another code editor) and  

run a python exercise.
